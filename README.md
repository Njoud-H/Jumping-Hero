# Jumping-Hero Game
Jumping Hero is a 1-button video game that made from handful parts in Arduino microcontroller and other electronics. 
The main objective is to build a complete game where all components located on a single breadboard, as well as showing the other side of creating games, that anyone can create its own from the scratch with simple requirements.

## Game-Story:
In the begging, this LCD screen will display a "Press to Start" message, in which the user should press the push button to start the game. After that, the hero will start walking, and while he does that, he will face many white obstacles in his way. At this time,  the user should press the button, so the hero can jump to skip them and record the highest scores.

## Hardware Components Used:
•	1 x Arduino UNO                   
•	1 x LCD screen (16 x 2 character)    
•	1 x Electronics breadboard   
•	1 x 220 Ω resistor   
•	1 x Pushbutton Switch    
•	Solid-core hookup wire   
•	1 x USB cable
